Project Drift is the working name for my asteroid mining adventure game. While the game is very early in development, some of the main things I'd like to try with the game:

* Smoothly deformable terrain for mining and exploration.
* Newtonian flight model with real thrusters.
* Real time lighting using 2D light fields.
* Dynamic ecosystem where resources exist in a cycle.

This is from a prototype a made a few years ago. Unfortunately I didn't make a lot of videos of it.
